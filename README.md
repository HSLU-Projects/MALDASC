## Setup

As we build on previous work of https://github.com/xyzlancehe/DentexSegAndDet the setup is a bit complicated.

1. Create a zip of the folder `previous_work`
2. _Optional:_ If not in HSLU network, download, install & connect to [HSLU VPN](https://www.hslu.ch/de-ch/wirtschaft/campus/bibliothek/infrastruktur/internet/)
3. Open [Jupyter Lab](https://gpuhub.labservices.ch)
4. Upload the `previous_work.zip` in root of the Jupyter Lab workspace
5. Copy & execute `0_Setup.ipynb`
